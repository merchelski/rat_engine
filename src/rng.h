/* This is xoroshiro128++ 1.0, one of our all-purpose, rock-solid,
   small-state generators. It is extremely (sub-ns) fast and it passes all
   tests we are aware of, but its state space is large enough only for
   mild parallelism.

   For generating just floating-point numbers, xoroshiro128+ is even
   faster (but it has a very mild bias, see notes in the comments).

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
   output to fill s. */
